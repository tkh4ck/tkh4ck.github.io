# SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2023

> Join the global cybersecurity community in its most festive cybersecurity challenge of the year. The SANS Holiday Hack Challenge is a FREE series of super fun, high-quality, hands-on cybersecurity challenges. The SANS Holiday Hack Challenge is for all skill levels, with a prize at the end for the best of the best entries.

> This year, Santa and the elves have moved to an island archipelago near the equator in the Pacific Ocean. On these Geese Islands, Santa's team is using a new Artificial Intelligence tool called ChatNPT to prepare for the annual gift-giving extravaganza. The elves need your help in making sure that they apply ChatNPT appropriately. To that end, we recommend that you set up and use your own free account in OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Bard, or Microsoft's Bing AI tools to help you solve challenges while learning vital cybersecurity lessons.
