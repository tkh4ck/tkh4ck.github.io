## Official CTF description

> Each Monday at 11:00AM ET, starting with the launch of the event on April 1, 2024 a new weekly challenge will be unlocked for participants to solve. For those who are interested, you’ll have one week to solve the question, followed by one additional week to write a blog for additional points. The Hexordia team will review the questions two weeks after they are initially posted, providing the solution to the solve on the weekly video. Each week when the new question is unlocked, the previous week’s question will be removed, so make sure to get your answers in!

> With the Weekly CTF Challenge we want to give as many ways as possible for participants to score points. Each week’s challenge will have a set points value based on the complexity of the solve. These point evaluations will range from 10-75 points. In addition to receiving points for providing the correct answer to each week’s challenge, you can also receive additional points in a variety of ways listed below.
