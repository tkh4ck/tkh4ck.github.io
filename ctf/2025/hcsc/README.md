Some statistics about the competition:

- 36 challenges
- 417 registered competitiors
- 72 hours of hacking
- 229 competitors submitted at least 1 flag

I achieved the 6th place. To get the final picture, this year's HCSC was a very tight competition, there was only a one challenge gap between the 1st and the 6th place, so I was really close, but really fat. I'm not satisfied, I could not solve 4 challenge, 2 of the were very close and I also mismanaged my time and sleeping schedule. Next time! Congratulations to all other competitiors, especially the winners of each category. And of course, many thanks to the Organizers!
