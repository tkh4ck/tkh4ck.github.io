## Solution

By analyzing the *PowerShell Event Log*, we can find events with ID `4104`, which refer to the *PowerShell Remoting* technique. This allows you to run *PowerShell* commands on a remote machine. The communication between the machines is done through the WinRM TCP port, which is port `5985`. So the first half of the solution is `winrm` and `5985`.

The IP address can be taken from the TGT request event in the previous challenge, for example. The solution is `192.168.238.132`. If you look for login events before running *PowerShell*, we can also find the IP address.
