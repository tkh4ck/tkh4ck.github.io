# XXI. Simonyi Conference

After a lecture I held at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics about a ransomware incident, I was honored to be invited to present the case at the XXI. Simonyi Conference 2024! üë®‚Äçüè´‚ò£Ô∏è

The title of the presentation was: `Tale of the 4 TB disk: An incident response story` (`Mese a 4 TB-os diszkr≈ël: Egy incidenskezel√©si t√∂rt√©net`) and it was held @ 2024 March 19, 15:15 - 15:45, IB025, I building, BME.

To reflect on the presentation:
- Twice as many people watched the presentation live as there were seats in the room, mostly university students as I think. I was surprised and I want to thank everybody who joined in person or via the live stream on Youtube.
- I usually try to make my presentations / lectures / trainings as interactive as possible and I try to involve the audience as much as possible. Fortunately, during this presentation the audience was open to this, they were proactive and tried to answer my questions, thank you again.
- I was afraid of the timing because previously this topic only fitted into a 2-hour long lecture. The presentation was a few minutes longer than the allocated 20 minutes and I had to rush a bit at the end, it wasn't a perfect finish to be honest, too sudden.
- The lights were unusual for me and I contantly stepped out them (I was in the shadow). It is a reflex that if I see a bright light during a presentation, it means that I'm in the path of the projector and block the presentation / projection. I this case it could not happend as there were no projectors, only an LED wall...
