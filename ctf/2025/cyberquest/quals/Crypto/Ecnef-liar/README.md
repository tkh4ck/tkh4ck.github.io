# CyberQuest 2025 - Ecnef liar

## Description

Sometimes the key is needed somewhere else than where you would think...

Decrypt the messages.txt using the key: `{T1tle_B4ckw4rds}`

Extend the flag to match this format: `CQ25{...}`

## Metadata

- Filename: [`message.txt`](files/message.txt) 
- Tags: `rail fence`

## Solution

The title backwards is `Rail Fence` which is a cipher:

<https://cryptii.com/pipes/rail-fence-cipher>

The ciphertext is the message: `Z4P1ZGIHRGC3`

The key should be 3.

The flag is: `CQ25{Z1GZ4GCIPH3R}`
